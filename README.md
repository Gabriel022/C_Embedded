# C_Embedded
Using C Code With IAR Embedded IDE
On this lab, we start using the ST ARM board and its interfaces. We needed to translate char characters to Morse code, so I build this code up mirroring my lab 2. After installing the IAR Embedded Workbench and inputting the STM32F0 Standard peripheral library into the path code of the C/C++ Compiler.
